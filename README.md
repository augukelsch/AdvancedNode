# 📡 Node.js Asynchronous Programming & Data Streaming

Welcome to this Node.js project inspired by the course [**"Node.js: Asynchronous Programming and Data Streaming" by Alex Banks**](https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?account=57692769&forceAccount=false&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fadvanced-node-js%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url%26shareId%3DKmNPvl1YSoiZTeJGkzy%252Fow%253D%253D) on LinkedIn Learning.

This repository contains practical examples, demos, and exercises exploring **advanced asynchronous patterns** and **streaming data processing** in Node.js.

## 📚 What This Project Covers

This project focuses on **real-world Node.js concepts** taught in the course, including:

### ✅ Asynchronous Programming Patterns

- Callbacks  
- Promises  
- Async/Await  
- Managing sequential, parallel, and concurrent execution flows  

### ✅ Node.js Streams

- Working with **Readable**, **Writable**, **Duplex**, and **Transform** streams  
- Handling **large data sets** efficiently  
- Minimizing **backpressure** to avoid bottlenecks  

### ✅ Building a Streaming HTTP Server

- **Streaming video** over HTTP  
- Handling **multipart/form-data** (file and text uploads)  
- Making streams **cross-browser compatible**  
- Real-time data handling with Node.js core modules  

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Node.js **v16+** recommended
- NPM (or Yarn)
